# Duplicate-Detection-Assignment
Duplicate Detection using LSH and Blocking
1) Use the data cleaning file
2) Perform Blocking- creating the blocks- division in base case and enhanced case
3) Extract the features and create binary matrices
4) Perform MinHashing
5) LSH - get candidate pairs
6) Jaccard Similarity and Agglomerative Clustering for duplicate detection
7) Evaluate LSH measures
8) Finally run main file, with bootstrapping and final results
